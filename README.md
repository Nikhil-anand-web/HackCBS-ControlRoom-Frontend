# Real-Time Detection and Tracking System for Enhanced Public Safety

## Problem Statement

In today's world, ensuring public safety is of paramount importance. Security agencies are constantly striving to identify and track individuals of concern who pose a threat to public gatherings or are evading law enforcement. To address this challenge, we have developed an innovative application that leverages AI technology for real-time detection and tracking of individuals of concern. This solution enhances public safety by providing central security agencies with the tools to monitor and respond to potential threats effectively.

## Solution Overview

Our application provides a user-friendly interface for central security agencies to upload photos and information about individuals of concern. The application utilizes AI technology to detect and track faces, making it a powerful tool for identifying threats and tracking individuals who are attempting to hide from authorities. Here's how our solution works:

1. **Face Detection:** The central security agency uploads a photo of the individual of concern into the application. The AI technology in the system processes the image and detects the person's face, creating a reference for tracking.

2. **Remote Access:** The application generates a unique link that can be accessed on smartphones from anywhere in the world. Security personnel and authorized users can access this link to remotely activate their smartphone's camera.

3. **Real-Time Monitoring:** When someone clicks on the provided link, their smartphone functions as a security camera. It continuously monitors the area where it is activated.

4. **Alerts and Reporting:** If the person of concern is seen in the monitored area, the smartphone camera captures images and sends them to our central system. Additionally, the system records the most recent location of the individual, creating a trail of their movements.

5. **Privacy and Security:** Only the central security agency has access to the location and image data. The system is designed to prioritize privacy and data security.
